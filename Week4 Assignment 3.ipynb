    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans:- Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling\n",
    "classes based on real-world objects, focusing only on the essential attributes and behaviors relevant to the \n",
    "application. It involves creating a higher-level representation of an object, hiding the unnecessary details while\n",
    "exposing a clear and concise interface for interaction.\n",
    "    In OOP, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and methods. An abstract class is a class that cannot\n",
    "be instantiated on its own and often contains one or more abstract methods. Abstract methods are declared in the\n",
    "abstract class but don't have any implementation. Subclasses of the abstract class are required to provide concrete\n",
    "implementations for the abstract methods, ensuring that they adhere to a certain structure.\n",

    "Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans:- Abstraction:\n",
    "    1.Purpose: Abstraction focuses on presenting only the necessary and relevant information about an object while\n",
    "hiding unnecessary details. It simplifies complex reality by providing a clear and high-level view of objects.\n",
    "    2.Implementation: Abstract classes and methods are used to achieve abstraction. Abstract classes define a structure\n",
    "with abstract methods, which subclasses must implement. This enforces a consistent interface while allowing different\n",
    "implementations.\n",
    "    3.Use Case: Abstraction is useful when you want to create a common blueprint for a group of related objects while\n",
    "hiding the implementation specifics. It helps manage complexity and provides a clear and standardized interface for \n",
    "interaction.\n",
    "  Example of Abstraction:\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Vehicle(ABC):  # Abstract class\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",

    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "    1.Purpose: Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data\n",
    "into a single unit (a class). It restricts direct access to the internal details of an object, promoting data hiding\n",
    "and controlled access.\n",
    "    2.Implementation: Access specifiers (public, protected, private) are used to control the visibility of attributes\n",
    "and methods. By default, Python uses name mangling to indicate private attributes (using a double underscore prefix),\n",
    "but true privacy isn't enforced.\n",
    "    3.Use Case: Encapsulation is useful for ensuring data integrity, hiding implementation details, and controlling\n",
    "access to attributes and methods. It prevents unintended modifications and provides a clear interface for interacting\n",
    "with objects.\n",
    "  Example of Encapsulation:\n",

    "        if amount <= self.__balance:\n",

    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "Ans:- Data abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the process of hiding the complex implementation\n",
    "details of data and providing a simplified and controlled interface for interacting with that data. It allows you to\n",
    "focus on using the data without needing to know how it's stored or manipulated internally. Achieving data abstraction\n",
    "involves two key concepts: encapsulation and abstract data types.\n",
    "    Here's how you can achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that\n",
    "data into a single unit, which is a class in OOP. Access to the internal data is controlled using access specifiers\n",
    "(public, protected, private). The idea is to expose only the necessary interfaces to the outside world while keeping\n",
    "the implementation details hidden.\n",
    "2.Abstract Data Types (ADTs): Abstract data types provide a high-level view of data structures or objects without\n",
    "revealing implementation details. You define what operations can be performed on the data and how the data behaves,\n",
    "but you don't need to expose the internal representation. ADTs ensure that the data's behavior is consistent with\n",
    "the expected functionality.\n",
